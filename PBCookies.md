# PB Chocolate Chunk Cookies
My favorite dessert that I make too often. These cookies carry a nice peanut butter flavor without overwhelming the chocolate and have a nice, salty kick. A recipe highlight is the unusual step of literally hand mixing the flour and peanut butter together.

## Ingredients
- 1 + 1/2 Cups Flour
- 1/2 TSP Salt
- 3/4 TSP Baking Soda
- 1 Cup Peanut Butter
- 1 Stick Unsalted Butter
- 3/4 Cup White Sugar
- 1/4 Cup Light Brown Sugar
- 2 TBSP Pure Maple Syrup
- 2 Egg (1 whole + 1 yolk)
- 1 TBSP Vanilla
- 1 bar (3.5oz) Bittersweet Chocolate ~70% Cacao


## For Finishing
-1/2 Cup White Sugar
- Large Sea Salt

## Equipment
- Oven
- 2 Baking Sheets
- Parchment Paper
- Double Boiler or Microwave
- Medium Heatproof or Microwave safe bowl, depending
- Large mixing bowl
- Rubber Spatula
- One extra-clean hand
- Fork
- Whisk
- Cooling Racks


# Steps
1) Prepare
Preheat oven to 350°f. Prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray down with non-stick spray and set aside.

2) Combine Dry Ingredients and Peanut Butter
In a large enough bowl to hold the full recipe, whisk dry ingredients together.​ Then, add peanut butter to dry ingredients. Using a clean hand, crumble/press the dry mixture and peanut butter together until you get a loose dough-like mixture similar in texture to wet sand. Set aside to rest.
- 1 + 1/2 Cup Flour
- 1/2 TSP Salt
- 3/4 TSP Baking Soda
- 1 Cup Peanut Butter

3) Combine Sugar and Butter
In a medium heat-proof (or microwave-safe) bowl, add 1 stick of butter. Either using a double boiler or a microwave, soften the butter until just melted. Be careful to not over cook. Add in white sugar, brown sugar, and maple syrup. Whisk until creamed (the color of the mixture should lighten slightly).
- 1 Stick Unsalted Butter
- 3/4 Cup White Sugar
- 1/4 Cup Light Brown Sugar
- 2 TBSP Pure Maple Syrup



4) Beat in Egg and Vanilla
In the butter-sugar mixture, crack egg, add egg yolk, and add vanilla. Whisk until egg is fully incorporated, but do not over whisk as it will add air to the mixture which can change the texture of the final result.
- 1 Whole Egg + 1 Egg Yolk
- 1 TBSP Vanilla



5) Combine Wet and Dry
In the bowl containing the PB-flour mixture, create a well in the center of the dough. Using a rubber spatula, scoop the sugar-butter-egg mixture into the well. Stir until well incorporated, with a texture that looks similar to ice-cream and the dough pulls away from the edges of the bowl easily. This may take a bit longer than you are used to, as the PB-flour mixture is fairly thick.

6) Chop and Add Chocolate
Roughly chop the bar of chocolate on a cutting board until you get loose, chip-sized pieces. The less consistent you are the better, as varying the size of the chocolate chunks helps improve the texture of the final cookie. Once chopper, use a rubber spatula to fold in the chocolate into the dough until roughly distributed.

7) Size, Shape, and Roll Cookies
Take the 1/2 cup sugar set aside for finishing and spread it out on a plate. Using an ice cream scoop (or a kitchen spoon), scoop dough into roughly 16 equal cookies one at a time. For each scoop, use the scoop and one hand to form the dough into a ball. Roll the ball in sugar until covered. Place on a baking sheet (each sheet will have 8 cookies in 2x4 arrangement).

8) Squash Cookies
Using the tines of a fork, press the cookies down until they are roughly half an inch tall. PB cookies tend to not spread out as much in baking, so they need help this way to cook evenly.  This will also give the cookies the distinctive 'peanut butter cookie' pattern.Sprinkle, the top of each cookie with a pinch or two of large, flakey sea salt

9) Bake
Place the baking sheets on two different oven racks. Bake for 6 minutes, then swap the baking sheets  and rotate each of them (this helps produce a more even bake). Bake for another 6 minutes (for a total of 12). Read the next step before removing the cookies from the oven.

10) Finish with Salt
Remove the baking sheets from the oven. Let the cookies rest on the baking sheets for 5 minutes then transfer to cooling racks and let cool completely.
